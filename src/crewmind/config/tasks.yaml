goal_setting_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the user's goal: "{{user_goal}}" with timeline "{{timeline}}" and help them create a well-defined 
    SMART goal structure. Consider their available time of {{available_time}} and current commitments: {{current_commitments}}. 
    Ensure the goal is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Break it into actionable milestones.
  expected_output: >
    A structured SMART goal document for "{{user_goal}}" containing: refined goal statement, specific success 
    criteria and metrics, realistic timeline breakdown for {{timeline}}, 3-5 major milestones with descriptions, 
    initial action steps for each milestone considering {{available_time}} availability, potential obstacles and 
    solutions, and motivation reminders for why this {{goal_type}} goal matters to the user.
  agent: goal_tracker_agent

progress_monitoring_task:
  description: >
    Create a progress monitoring framework for the goal "{{user_goal}}" with {{timeline}} timeline. 
    Design tracking methods that work with {{available_time}} availability and {{preferred_schedule}} preferences. 
    Consider the user's {{motivation_level}} motivation level and create appropriate check-in frequencies.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive progress monitoring plan including: tracking methods for "{{user_goal}}", milestone 
    check-in schedule aligned with {{timeline}}, progress measurement techniques suitable for {{available_time}} 
    commitment, motivational strategies matching {{motivation_level}} level, accountability systems, and 
    adjustment protocols for staying on track with this {{goal_type}} goal.

weekly_schedule_task:
  description: >
    Design a weekly schedule for achieving "{{user_goal}}" within {{timeline}}. Work around existing commitments: 
    {{current_commitments}} and optimize for {{preferred_schedule}} timing. Allocate the available {{available_time}} 
    effectively while considering {{difficulty_preference}} challenge level and {{motivation_level}} energy.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed weekly schedule for "{{user_goal}}" featuring: specific time blocks during {{preferred_schedule}} 
    periods, integration with current commitments ({{current_commitments}}), daily habits supporting the {{goal_type}} 
    goal, {{available_time}} time allocation across the week, energy-matched activities, buffer time for flexibility, 
    and contingency plans. Include morning/evening routines optimized for {{timeline}} success.

daily_planning_task:
  description: >
    Create daily action plans for "{{user_goal}}" that fit within {{available_time}} and align with 
    {{preferred_schedule}} preferences. Break down weekly milestones into daily tasks considering 
    {{current_commitments}} and {{motivation_level}} energy patterns. Design for {{difficulty_preference}} intensity.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive daily planning system for "{{user_goal}}" including: daily task breakdowns fitting 
    {{available_time}} constraints, {{preferred_schedule}} optimized timing, top 3 priority actions per day, 
    integration with {{current_commitments}}, energy-matched task sequencing for {{motivation_level}} patterns, 
    transition buffers, progress check-ins aligned with {{timeline}}, reflection prompts, and tomorrow's 
    preparation steps. Include {{accountability_preference}} elements and {{goal_type}} specific strategies.
